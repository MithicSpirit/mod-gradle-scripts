# Mod Gradle Scripts

This repository contains Gradle scripts that contain shared code between projects.
This is intended to reduce the build script boilerplate in individual projects.

This script supports:

- Fabric Loom `1.4+`
- NeoGradle `7.0+`
- ForgeGradle `6.0+`


Gradle version `8.5+` is required.
